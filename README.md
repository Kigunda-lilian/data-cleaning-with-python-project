# Instructions

As a Data Science Consultant, you have been tasked to provide recommendations on
how to reduce the cases of breakdown of buses in the city of New York.
The dataset that you have been provided comes from the Bus Breakdown and Delay
system which collects information from school bus vendors operating out in the field in
real-time. Bus staff that encounter delays during the route are instructed to radio the
dispatcher at the bus vendorâ€™s central office. The bus vendor staff are then instructed to
log into the Bus Breakdown and Delay system to record the event and notify OPT. OPT
customer service agents use this system to inform parents who call with questions
regarding bus service. The Bus Breakdown and Delay system is publicly accessible and
contains real-time updates. All information in the system is entered by school bus vendor
staff.
You start this project by reading, exploring, cleaning and later onwards performing an
analysis of your dataset.

You have been provided with the following guiding questions for your analysis. Come up
with many more other questions.
1. Which bus companies had the highest breakdowns?
2. What were the top 3 reasons for bus delays?
3. How many students were on the buses when they broke down?
4. Which were the most frequent reasons for bus breakdowns?
5. What were the most frequent reasons for the bus running late?
6. What was the average delay time of each reason type?

You will be required to use the following template [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yEJAgvuThBLfEbMJvG3EDHARzAWfBSSI?usp=sharing) as a guide, which will use some
learnings from the CRISP-DM methodology that you earlier learned about last week. You
can delete the guiding notes.
